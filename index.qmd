# Burden of Healthcare Associated Infections in Australia

Joint work with Brett Mitchell, Tracey Bucknall, Allen Cheng, Phil Russo & Andrew Stewardson

## Healthcare asociated infections {.smaller}

Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Five of the most common HAIs are:

* Clostridiodes difficile --- causes severe damage to the colon, can be fatal
* Bloodstream infection (sepsis) --- estimated mortality rate of 15-30%
* Urinary track infection --- low mortality but associated with multi-drug resistance and significantly longer stays
* Healthcare acquired pneumonia --- mortality rate of 40-70%, increasing dramatically with age
* Surgical site infection --- significantly increases length of stay

::: {.fragment}
But, HAIs are not notifiable => We have no robust way to track whether their prevalence is increasing or decreasing.
:::

## Overseas monitoring

HAIs are actively monitored across Europe through the ECDC.

In 2016 (based on 2012 data), 2,609,911 new HAIs are estimated to have occurred.

::: {.fragment}
The data for this was a _point prevalence survey_, on an enormous scale:

* 273,753 patients
* 1,149 hospitals
:::

## Point prevalence survey

A point prevalence survey counts the number of people with a condition on a given day.

We ran a PPS in Australia in 2019, consisting of:

* Adults in [19]{.fragment fragment-index=5} [large]{.fragment fragment-index=2} [acute care]{.fragment fragment-index=4} [public]{.fragment fragment-index=3} hospitals

All acute cards wards were included. Non-acute, paediatric, NICU, rehab, and ED were excluded.

::: {.fragment}
The hospitals sampled make up approximately 60% of all overnight separations in Australia.
:::

## Point prevalence survey

* 2767 patients sampled between 6 Aug and 29 Nov 2018
* Median age: 67 (range 18-104)
* 52.9% male, 46.6% female, 0.5% unknown/other
* 85.7% patients in major city hospitals

# Methodology time

We have to go from point prevalence to annual incidence...

## Estimation methodology

#### Step 1: Estimation of hospital prevalence

Hospital Prevalence ($P$) is estimated as:

$$P = r \times \text{Beta}(n_\text{obs}, N - n_\text{obs}+1) + (1-r) \times \text{Beta}(n_\text{obs}+1, N-n_\text{obs}),$$

where $n_\text{obs}$ is the number of patients observed with a HAI and $N$ is the total number of patients in the PPS.

This is a standard extrapolation from a binomial sample with a lot of zeros.

## Estimation methodology

#### Step 2: Estimation of hospital incidence

Hospital incidence ($I$) calculated as:

$$I = P \frac{LA}{LOI},$$

where:

* $P$ is the hospital prevalence from Step 1
* $LA$ is the mean length of stay and
* $LOI$ is the length of infection

::: {.fragment}
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Australia actually captures $LA$ through the AIHW ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
:::

## Estimation methodology

#### Step 2a: Length of infection

$LOI$ is not available, but instead we have $LOI_{pps}$ --- the length of infection until the date of survey. We can calculate

$$P(LOI_{pps} = 1),$$

which is just the probability that a patient is in the first day of their HAI. Then,

$$E[LOI] = 1/P(LOI_{pps} = 1).$$

For a small sample size, this is heavily biased, so we take a mixture of this estimator and $E[LOI_{pps}]$.

## Estimation methodology

#### Step 3: Estimation of population incidence

Calculate population incidence simply as

$$I_\text{pop} = I \times N_\text{discharges}.$$

::: {.fragment}
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We capture this too! $N_\text{discharges} = 3,713,513,$ 60% of the total admissions in a given year. 
:::

::: {.fragment}
In the ECDC PPS, this quantity is **not** captured. They estimate using patient-days and the number of patients.
:::

## Estimation methodology

#### Step 4: Stratification by age and sex

Use a multinomial likelihood function with a Dirichlet prior, with weights taken from the number of cases in each age/sex category.

::: {.fragment}
A psuedocount is added to each strata ($0.001 \sum{\text{weights}}$) to ensure the likelihood can be calculated with empty strata.
:::

## Estimation methodology

#### Step 5: Adjustment for life expectancy

Use the "McCabe score", which gives the life expectancy according to secerity of a disease.

Patients are categorised as:

* non-fatal
* fatal (average life expectancy of 3 years)
* [rapidly fatal (average life expectancy of 0.5 years)]{.fragment}

::: {.fragment}
These scores, combined with disease outcome trees, give DALYs and deaths.

## Novelty

* First estimate of HAI burden in Australia using (relatively) robust survey data in an established framework
* Based on first point prevalence survey since 1984

* There is no routine surveillance of HAIs in Australia
* Point prevalence surveys remain the only way to understand the burden of these conditions

## Summary

* 498 DALYs per 100,000 is a large amount
    * Motor vehicles: 180 DALYs
    * Infectious diseases: 370 DALYs
    * Respiratory diseases: 1380 DALYs

::: {.fragment}
This work has informed guidance on HAI surveillance in Australia, including new funding schemes to better understand these conditions.

::: {.fragment}
And all this based on just 2767 patients from 19 hospitals...

# HAIs are largely preventable.

They represent great opportunity for improvement, and we have a long way to go to prevent them entirely.
